    <h3>J O U R N A L</h3>
    <p>1952, Yasuoka, Japan.<br>The end of our village seems inevitable. Recently disappearances and rumours about shape shifting creatures roaming the woods increased. All the women [<span style="text-weight: bold; color: #ffd41d; text-shadow: 1px 1px #333;">★</span>] already fled. Except for me only two men [<span style="text-weight: bold; color: #53b848; text-shadow: 1px 1px #333;">⬟</span>], Adam and Evan, remain. I wish I could do something to rescue my home. But I only seem to get in the way of others. Tonight I will put and end to this and commit sudoku.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;ーNouke Takashi [能<span style="text-weight: bold; color: #f00; text-shadow: 1px 1px #333;">化</span> 陸]</p>
    <h3>S C E N A R I O</h3>
    <p>You're Takashi's spirit and have the ability to temporarily turn men into women. Help repopulate your village! Careful though: if a person is seen while you change their sex, they'll be hunted down for being a shape shifter.<br>You have 24 hours left before your spirit vanishes into the plain of high heaven. </p>

    <p>〔壱〕 Offspring resulting from encounters under your influence seems to be exclusively male. To trigger migration into the village and secure the continued survival of your home it has to reach a population of at least 15.</p>
    <p>〔弐〕 Villagers are afraid to be alone and therefore seek the company of others. You can, however, lure individuals away from a group.</p>
    <p>〔参〕 Villagers may loose their mind and behave strangely from time to time. Waiting usually solves the provlem.</p>
